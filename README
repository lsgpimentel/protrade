To CHECKOUT project from github:

  set .ssh key as described here - http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/

  mkdir tennis-trader
  cd tennis-trader
  git init
  git remote add origin git@github.com:paul-g/tennis-trader.git
  git pull -u origin master


To RUN you can use Ant (make sure you have it installed properly):

    First create a file called build.properties in the project root.
    (Simply copy tennis-trader/examples/build.properties.example to tennis-trader/build.properties)
    Then set lin.ver to either 32 or 64, based on your linux version(32-bit/64-bit) and you're good to go.

   Available targets are:
    ant clean
    ant compile - to build all classes under src/ in build/prod/
    ant run - to run the src.HelloWorld class
    
   If everything is OK, you should see a window with a tree list pop up.


To COMMIT:
  
  NOTE!!!!!! 
  Please do not commit any local configuration files, build outputs, test outputs etc. to the respository.

  ant clean                -> removes build output
  git status               -> shows a list of changed / added files
  git add <file1> <file2>  -> list all the files you want to commit
  git commit -m "<Comment for commit>"
