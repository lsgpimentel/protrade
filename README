FIRST, cd to the root of the project:
e.g. for
tennis-trader/
  lib/
  src/
  README

cd tennis-trader

THEN:

   FOR 32 bit JVM on LINUX:
     Set Makefile.local LIN_VER = 32

  FOR 64 BIT JVM ON LINUX:
     Set Makefile.local LIN_VER = 64

BUILD:
	make build

RUN:
	make run
	
If everything is OK, you should see an empty window pop up.

p.s. ANT SCRIPT IS COMING....
