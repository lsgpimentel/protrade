To CHECKOUT project from github:

  set .ssh key as described here - http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/
  then

    mkdir tennis-trader
    cd tennis-trader
    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:paul-g/tennis-trader.git
    git pull -u origin master


To RUN - you can use Makefile or Ant

  Makefile:

    FOR 32 bit JVM on LINUX:
       Set Makefile.local LIN_VER = 32
         
    FOR 64 BIT JVM ON LINUX:
       Set Makefile.local LIN_VER = 64
  
    THEN
      cd tennis-trader
      make
      
    BUILD:
  	  make build
  
    RUN:
  	  make run
  	
  If everything is OK, you should see a window with a tree list pop up.

  Ant:
  
    FOR 32 bit JVM on LINUX:
       <property name="lin.ver" value="32" />
  
    FOR 64 BIT JVM ON LINUX:
       <property name="lin.ver" value="64" />
  
    ant clean
    ant compile - to build all classes under src/ in build/prod/
    ant run - to run the src.HelloWorld class
    
  Again, if everything is OK, you should see a window with a tree list pop up.


To COMMIT:
  run a 'make clean' or 'ant clean' to delete the *.class
  git status               -> shows a list of changed / added files
  git add <file1> <file2>  -> list all the files you want to commit
  git commit -m "<Comment for commit>"


To CHECKIN:
  git push -u origin master
